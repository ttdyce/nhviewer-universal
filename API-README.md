(20250328 some server is really slow these days, an idea for this issue is to pick the fastest one by requesting i[1-4] page 1 of each comic. Also, show the blurred image from t[1-4] first woulld be helpful too)

## API issues with language keywords

In recent years, certain query string trigger an empty response randomly. This may affect searching and language filtering. As a workaround, the app now store some query alternatives. It may switch to these language keywords when needed.

> Example of search api: https://nhentai.net/api/galleries/search?query=language:chinese

- Alternatives
  - -language:english -language:japanese
  - chinese
  - 汉化
  - 中国

> Example tag api https://nhentai.net/api/galleries/tagged?tag_id=29963&page=1

Calling tag api is another solution, worth trying when search is not available. Currently the app is not using this one though.
